These are data from Marta Garrido's original MMN study 

http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1053811907002273

The data were preprocessed as described in the paper (see dataset history for the exact settings). 
Each epoched file was used to generate two evoked datasets with odd/even split to test for reproducibility.
For all subjects the standard condition is an average of ~200 trials and the oddball condition of ~50 trials.
